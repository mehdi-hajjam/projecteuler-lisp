This folder is a personal effort through ProjectEuler.net archive problems with the language LISP.
To conform with the philosophy of this website, please make sure you solve the problems **on your own** before looking at my own solution to the problem.

###### About Project Euler
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a neat way to find interesting mathematical problems, while filtering on efficient solutions with the constraint of convergence under a minute on a regular computer. Please do not make easily accessible solutions to the most recent problems.

###### About LISP
One of the oldest programming language there is : don't be thrown off by the syntax - beyond lies a new paradigm in your practice of programming.
